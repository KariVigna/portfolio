    <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p><strong>Here are some of my projects I've created while learning at Epicodus</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/KariVigna/hey-world">hey world</a></h3>
            <p>Here is the repository for a project titled hey world. This project uses only in-line HTML. This project was my first practice making commits.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/KariVigna/my-first-webpage">my first webpage</a></h3>
            <p>Here you will find the repository for an early project titled my first webpage. This project features in-line HTML as well as a customized style sheet written in CSS. It also provided me with more practice making commits.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3><a href="karivigna.github.io/my-pets">my pets</a></h3>
            <p>Here is the Github pages link for a practice project about my pets. After taking some time to process what I've learned so far, I wanted to gain further muscle memory creating pages. This project not only features in-line HTML and a customized stylesheet, but also a github pages branch so it can be accessed in any browser. The README is written in markdown.
            <span class="warning">Warning: contains photos of a snake and a tarantula</span></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3><a href="">My Portfolio</a></h3>
            <p>Here you will find the repository and README for this project you are looking at! This page was made using in-line HTML and a customized CSS stylesheet. The README is written in markdown.</p>
        </li>

    <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class="sections">I had decided to take this class on programming because I wanted something <em>drastically</em> different from my previous endevours. Coming from only basic college and working almost strictly food service jobs, I decided it was time to make a smarter investment in my family's future. I hope this only furthers my curiosity and desire to grow.</p>
