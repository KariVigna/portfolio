    <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class="sections">I had decided to take this class on programming because I wanted something <em>drastically</em> different from my previous endevours. Coming from only basic college and working almost strictly food service jobs, I decided it was time to make a smarter investment in my family's future. I hope this only furthers my curiosity and desire to grow.</p>
