<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I had decided to take this class on programming because I realized I needed something drastically different than what I was already doing, so that I can further support my child in the life they want. Coming from only basic college and working almost strictly food service jobs, it was time to make a smart choice for my future. I hope this only furthers my curiosity and desire to grow.</p>
